Description:
We want to create a simple, platformer desktop game or other simple game for user entertainment.  We plan to develop in C# using the open-source Unity Engine.  We also may build a more useful game (imagine a to-do list that keeps track of your "points" or completed items).
This game will feature usernames and their associated high scores.  The usernames and highscores are to be stored in a database so the user can keep track of their progress.  

Vision Statement: 
We would like to make a fun, functioning game that is entertaining for the user.

Motivation:
Games are entertaining and it's easy to implement some sort of database feature (i.e. usernames and highscores).




Risks: 

Unity and C# are new to most of our team members, and none of us have developed using a database before.   

Risk Mitigation Plan:
Meticulous scheduling of the early tasks will establish a solid base for our project.  During each sprint's planning phase, each team member is expected to somewhat familiarize themselves with the tools needed for the upcoming tasks. 

Version Control:

We will be using a distributed repository (GitHub) for this project in order to maintain code consistency and integrity between versions. 

Development Method:

We would like to use the Agile methodology with Scrum for this project. Since many of the team members are not familiar with game development or C#, we will need a flexible development methodology. We chose Scrum since the sprint format allows us to pace the learning curve, ensuring that we learn the methods we need as we need them. This helps with ensuring that the early scheduling goes smoothly.

Collaboration Tool:

Currently we are using GroupMe in order to text chat with teammates. As the project continues to evolve we may look at video chat apps as necessary.

Repo organization/structure:

The home folder will contain all of the Milestones as well as all of the other needed files for our project and a folder named "3308 Project". This folder is the folder needed to run our project on Unity along with all of its scripts.

How to build/run our program:

There are two options for downloading and running the game.

1.  The first way to download and run the game is to download the zip file at this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Iut5Wzy4O9UThDQzFYZ0I0M2c/view?usp=sharing, extract the zipped folder, and run the .exe within.  IMPORTANT: the data folder must be in the same directory as the .exe to run!  Also, the game doesn't scale perfectly at strange aspect ratios; for the game to look the best, choose a resolution that keeps the 16:9 aspect ratio (such as 1440x900 or 1920x1080) and run in windowed mode.

2.  The second option is to preview the game in the Unity client itself.  In order to do this, one must download Unity version 5.5.2f to be able to run the program. Then you would have to run our program through the 3308 project folder.
